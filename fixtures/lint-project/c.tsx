      For readability we recommend against using more than 80 characters: In code styleguides, maximum line length rules
      are often set to 100 or 120. However, when humans write code, they don’t strive to reach the maximum number of
      columns on every line. Developers often use whitespace to break up long lines for readability. In practice, the
      average line length often ends up well below the maximum. Prettier’s printWidth option does not work the same way.
      It is not the hard upper allowed line length limit. It is a way to say to Prettier roughly how long you’d like
      lines to be. Prettier will make both shorter and longer lines, but generally strive to meet the specified
      printWidth. Remember, computers are dumb. You need to explicitly tell them what to do, while humans can make their
      own (implicit) judgements, for example on when to break a line. In other words, don’t try to use printWidth as if
      it was ESLint’s max-len – they’re not the same. max-len just says what the maximum allowed line length is, but not
      what the generally preferred length is – which is what printWidth specifies.
